      <h1>Game Rules</h1>

      <h3>Coins</h3>

      <p>You do not need to buy any coins to play. You win coins by leveling up and winning games.</p>

      <h3>Leveling Up</h3>
      <p>New levels are achieved by the rules below. Correct answers do not have to be in a row.</p>
      <h5>Level &nbsp; 1 - 10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5 correct</h5>
      <h5>Level 11 - 20 &nbsp; 10 correct</h5>
      <h5>Level 21 - 30 &nbsp; 15 correct</h5>
      <h5>Level 31+ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20 correct</h5>

      <h3>Objective</h3>

      <p>The goal is to collect game pieces from each of the six categories represented on the wheel: Entertainment,
        Science,
        Art, Geography, History, and Sports. The first player to obtain all six pieces wins the game.</p>

      <h3>How to obtain game pieces</h3>

      <p>To obtain a game piece, a player must correctly answer three questions in a row, or land on the Bonus section
        of the
        wheel. Once one of these events has occurred, the player will choose between challenging the opponent for one of
        their
        game pieces, or answering a new question from one of the six categories. If the player answers correctly, they
        win
        a game piece representing the category of the bonus question they chose.</p>

      <h3>Challenge</h3>

      <p>To start a challenge in a Bonus round, both players must have at least one game piece. The player starting the
        challenge (challenger) will select the game piece they wish to bet. Next the challenger will choose a game piece
        belonging to the opponent (defender) to compete for.</p>

      <p>Both players are presented with the same six questions, one from each category. The player who answers the most
        questions correctly will be the winner of the challenge.</p>

      <p>If the challenger is victorious, he will get the game piece from the defender, and the defender will lose that
        piece.</p>

      <p>If the defender wins, he retains his game piece. The challenger loses the game piece he bet at the start of the
        challenge.</p>

      <p>In the case of a tie, the defender will receive a bonus question from a random category. If he answers
        correctly, he
        wins the challenge. If he answers incorrectly, the challenger wins.</p>

      <h3>End of the game</h3>

      <p>The first player to obtain the six game pieces withs the game.</p>
